# eclipse BPMN setup

To edit BPMN files in Eclipse you will need to install some plugins that can't be found through the marketplace anymore. To do so,

- import the p2f file using File > Import > Software Items from File > Choose the p2f file

You should now see the BPMN and its properties in Eclipse as graphs.
